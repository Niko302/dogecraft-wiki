## Roles
Owners, Admins, Moderators, Helpers, Architects, Manager and Interns: below is a list of who can do what.

### Interns
Our Trusted players are members of the community that have proven to be outstanding citizens. These hand picked citizens are trusted with chat moderation to enforce our chat rules. If an Interrn asks you to stop spamming etc please listen otherwise they will follow through with the correct reprimand/punishment. These players do not have the ability to fix grief but are usually well versed in our game. Please feel free to ask them questions. Interns are our first official level of staff. To become an Intern please apply on our forums.
<br><b>Skill Set: Moderates chat, good knowledge of our server, outstanding members of our society. </b>

### Helpers
Our AMAZING Helpers are here to help! Need some grief fixed? Have a question about commands? Helpers can help! Helpers are also chat moderators. Helpers handle MOST inside the minecraft world. Please contact a Helper before seeking an admin or the owner.
<br><b>Skill Set: Chat moderators, fixes common problems, answers questions, loves to help out. </b>

### Manager
Have a problem? Need to report a bug/glitch or issue? Please see the Manager. Our Manager works hard to put together weekly staff meetings and keep everyone in the loop on what's going on and when. The Manager can help direct you to the right member of staff to solve your issue. 
<br><b>Skill Set: Paperwork, takes notes, gathers data, Public Relations, Human Relations, secretary.</b>

### Builders
A special note about our builders. We appreciate all our staff and know they work very hard. Our build team recently has undergone a lot of changes. From now on we will be looking for good builders to work with us on a test server to build events and other things we need. Please contact LadyAnime if you would like to be considered to be on this list. Not everyone will be able to help out but we appreciate everyone that applies for it and will keep you in mind for future projects.
Current list of projects for builders: None at the moment. Please check back later.

### Moderators and Admins
Our Moderators and Admins work closely together to tackle the bigger issues when they arise. Moderators are often players that have been Helpers for a long time and are trusted with the responsibility of bigger jobs. Our Moderators are often on call and pop in and out of game when needed. If you feel you need a Mod or Admin please talk to a Helper before hand. Admins are the only ones besides the Owners that can remove/change/alter a residence. If you need help with this particular issue and have asked a Helper please go on our discord and report the issue under "support". 
<br><b>Skill Set: Always watching, able to come to the rescue, fixes larger issues/problems, amazing people. </b> 

### Owners
Our wonderful Owners have been supporting our daily Dogecraft lives from behind the scenes since the beginning. Often you will see one or the other in game but please be aware they are usually working on the foundation of our world. Please seek a Helper before trying to get the Owners attention. Some issues can ONLY be solved by the Owners but most things can be handled by our other Staff. 
<br><b>SKill Set: Able to spawn in items, can make massive changes to the game, often very busy.</b>

## Want to join our team?
Wonderful! We would LOVE to have you! There are some conditions, we only accept applications on our website. Please fill out our forum exactly as asked and take it seriously. We are a team but these are basically jobs and should be treated as such. We ask that you be an active member of our community for at least two weeks. This helps you know us and we can get to know you. The more helpful you are in the community the better. HOWEVER, if staff is handling an issue PLEASE let staff handle the issue. "Mini-modding" is not in the rulebook as of yet but please don't make us put it in there. Let staff handle issues, you can be helpful by answering questions or by helping guide new players around. We also ask you to be at least 16 years of age. While we do make exceptions this is our current policy. We do get a large number of applications and only have so many spots available. Please apply again later if you don't get staff the first try. 


## Team Power!
Our team each have their own unique set of abilities, we use these all together to make Dogecraft the best it can be. Helper to Owner every member of our staff is important. Please treat all staff with equal respect. If you disrespect our staff or do not cooperate, staff will have to escalate the situation. Staff is here to help, please do not take matters into your hands when it comes to grief etc. While our team is separated into ranks and groups we are all on the same page. We have weekly meetings and several conversations between them to keep up to date on Doge. While individuals may handle situations differently we are all on the same page about the rules and guidelines.
