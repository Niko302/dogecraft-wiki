# Punishment Guidelines

**These are some different types of punishments and what you can do about them:**

* **WARNINGS**: These carry over a span of seven days, once four are hit, the user is auto-banned for an hour.
* **KICK**: Kicks you from the server. Can immediately rejoin.
* **TEMPBAN**: 24 hours - 7 days or up to staff decision.
* **MUTE**: Anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours or more. This is usually due to chat rule violations and is up to the staff member to decide how long it lasts.
* **PERMABAN**: Indefinite. 
If you feel like you were unfairly permabanned please appeal on the forums HOWEVER if your punishment lasts less than 24 hours please just serve the time.
