# General chat rules

1. Breaking rules will result in punishments. See Punishment Guidelines for more info.
2. Listen to staff. If someone says Stop then Stop.
3. Respect each other. Example if they ask you to change the subject PLEASE do so.
4. Chat is usually kept PG13. Please keep role playing to PMs or party chats. 
5. No advertising. No Youtube/minecraft servers/discords. Period. This will result in a tempban or permaban and chat clear.
6. Name calling/Bullying/Harassment/abuse/hate speech/discriminatory speech will NOT be tolerated. Do NOT use the "n" word. This is a PERMABAN. Aimed at someone or not. Circumventing/misspelling/naming items will result in PermaBan. Usage of slurs or speaking in a racist way will get you banned.
7. Chat may be cleared if the above rule is broken. 
8. Light swearing is allowed but do not aim it at other people.
9. Don't Spam. Use the "LESS than 5" rule on caps + repeating characters. Staff will verball warn you then move to a /warn or /tempmute if needed. If you are not listening to verbal warnings, or have a previous history of being told/warnings, staff might move directly to a short tempmute or tempban depending on what you are doing.
10. Spamming also includes PARTICIPATING or clearly trying to initiate spam. Exception is 'f' for deaths and 'gg'.
11. Please do not intentionally give players false/fake information. "Alt + f4" is not how to craft anything. 
12. Please do not /ignore staff or trusted players as you will not see their verbal warnings and may end up being /warned for chat rule violations.
13. No talk of Suicide, in game or discord, this makes everyone uncomfortable. Please contact a suicide hotline if you feel you need help. 
14. If you are MUTED in game please do NOT talk in discord global chat channel. This is mute evasion and you will have your discord perms removed. 
15. If you have someone /ignored please don't go on the discord to talk to them through the global chat channel.
16. If you have issues with another player please contact staff. Do NOT contact the other player OUTSIDE of minecraft. Please come to staff to help resolve the issue. Harassment OUTSIDE of game and INSIDE of game are taken very seriously. 
17. Even as a joke please do not talk about demoting staff, if you have a complaint please take it to the discord or the forums. Arguing in game against a staff member will only escalate your punishment faster. 
18. Please avoid naming items, tools or weapons anything that would violate the general chat rules. We may ask you to rename the item if we feel it doesn't comply with the rules. 
19. English only in main chat please. Use party chat or pms for other languages.
