# Skyblock Rules

Do Not build things or devices that trap/harm or kill a player.<br>
Griefing/Stealing is Not allowed. If it isnâ€™t your item or build leave it alone. Tampering with someone elses area is not ok.<br>
Scamming is Not allowed. Violating this may result in a ban.<br>
If move perms are turned off on a res it is Trespassing to enter that res.<br>
Illegal use of private grinders is also trespassing. <br>
If you are asked to leave a property please do so.<br>
Stalking / harassment of other players is not allowed.<br>
If you box someone in on all sides so they cannot expand their res at all you may be asked to delete your claim.<br>

## Grinders, Hoppers, auto-clickers, auto farms
Auto farms/grinders with spawners are Not allowed. Auto farms are allowed if there are No spawners involved. Letting these run while you are actively in or around your base is fine. Please turn them off when not in use to reduce lag.<br>
No Afking at automatic machines for longer than 30 minutes. Afking there will lead to warning, tempbans and then permaban.<br>
If you need to afk for more than a few minutes please go somewhere safe /spawn. If your res has no move perms and you are afk for more than 30 minutes you may end up being moved to spawn to avoid kicking you.<br>
No Afk pools or methods that prevent you from being kicked. You may be tempbanned.<br>
Auto-clickers are okay but you MUST be present at your computer. If you do not answer staff you may be kicked/warned.<br>
0 tick farms are not allowed. <br>
Automatic Iron golem farms are allowed. <br>
Redstone clocks that do not cause lag are allowed. <br>
Building on top of the nether for gold farms is allowed.<br>
Auto fish farms are not allowed.<br>
Auto smelters are allowed.<br>
No lag machines or excessive redstone. If staff deems your machine or build to be lagging the server or deem it to be against the rules please dismantle it asap. It may be dismantled for you if it causes server issues.<br>
Intentionally trying to lag or crash the server will result in a permanent ban.<br>
If you can make your set up toggle please do so and turn it off while not in use.<br>
